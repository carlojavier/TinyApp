# TinyApp Project (whaaaat...!)

A rustic, full stack web application built with Node and Express that enables URL-shortening.

## The Goal

~~To do well in the bootcamp~~ To exhibit progress in many aspects of full stack web development, especially my understanding of JavaScript, EJS, Node, and HTTP.

## Final Product

(note that further improvements to the front end is possible over this weekend)





## Dependancies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session
- cookie-parser (before we CUT IT! lol)

### The Story So Far

_I was a young man once._ Work on this app feels like it started long ago, when it was actually just this past Tuesday. Gah!
